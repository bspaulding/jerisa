<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>What can I say, I fell hard for the boy who my mom thought was "very attractive". To paraphase for those who have yet to hear this story, as a freshman I brought Justin home to pick up one of my old prom dresses so that his girlfriend could wear it to a special event. If you missed it he had a girlfriend, a girlfriend who happened to be my resident advisor.</p>

<p>Anyways, a little later mom approaches to me in the kitchen to say, "that boy you brought home, your friend...he's very attractive."</p>
<p>Thinking it was hysterical, I made her say it a few more times and then dismissed the thought because we were just friends. And the friend zone was where we stayed for the following two years. As friends we shared laughs, long talks over coffee, and crazy midnight adventures to CVS for icecream. However, when the tables turned and he was suddenly single, I found myself in a relationship that drove us apart. That was until, in their quest for a new church, Julia and Tommy visited a service where he was leading worship. Julia's exact words to me, "Cherisa, I think you got it wrong. Your friend Justin does not lead there. The guy I saw was in his thirties and looked like Ryan Reynolds." But, that hott, "thirty" (23) year old was in fact him. We laughed about as we reconnected over the phone. Then, he asked me to hang out- as two single, old friends just catching up. Within two "hanging out" dates I was sure he was the man I wanted to marry. So much so that I blurted out I love you first-not prototypical of me at all. He eventually followed suit and after a year he proposed in the sweetest way I could image. What else can I say... he thinks it's cute when I whine, he knows all of my faces, he reminds me of daddy, he brings out the best in me, he encourages me to pray and grow in my faith, he brings me chocolate on rainy days (and lots of other ones too), he edits my schoolwork, he lets me paint his face and his fingernails, he comforts me when I'm sick...I get to marry my very best friend.</p>
